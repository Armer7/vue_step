# armercosmetic

This is VUE SPA online cosmetics store. This is the graduation work at the end of the “IT STEP academy”. I was given a [design layout](https://www.figma.com/file/goQ1ITROSykGBgJzA1polF/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8B-%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F-%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2-Copy-Copy?node-id=1%3A3289).  It is necessary to perform layout according to the design layout and implement the functionality at your discretion.

### Used FrameWorks

Typeset - HTML5, CSS3 and [mdbootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/vue/).
